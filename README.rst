Purpose of the package
**********************

The package ``gbj_config`` contains just one module ``config`` with classes
and functions for processing configuration INI files, mostly for reading from
them.

- The package is treated as a git submodule and is usually involved into other
  Python packages as a sub-package.

- In either case the package can be installed individually as a standalone
  Python package.
